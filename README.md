# EEG-DURING-MENTAL-ARTHMETIC-TASK
RESEARCH PROJECT, AIM IS TO CLASSIFY THE EEG SIGNALS DURING THE REST STATE AND MENTAL ARITHMETIC TASK STATE

objective: To Classify Active state and Inactive state of the signal using raw EEG dataset

Dataset:  16 subjects loaded: each subect correspond to 2 file: before arthmetic task(3 min) raw EEG signals and during arthmetic task raw EEG signals(1min)

Input: 21 features corresponding to 90k rows therefore final dataset size is 90k*21

output: labels 0, 1 active or inactive respectively

3 models were tested in this experiment:
   -1) LSTM MODEL
   -2) BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM 
   -3) LSTM WITH ATTENTION
   

DATA PREPROCESSING
1) DATA RESAMPLLING:-  3 MIN DATA(WHICH IS OF BEFORE ARTHMETIC TASK) IS RESAMPLED INTO THE 1 MIN DATA, THEREFORE  90K ROWS CONVERTED INTO THE 30K
                       
2) DATA LABELLING: RESAMPLED DATA WHIHC IS OF BEFORE ARTHMETIC TASK IS RESAMPLED IS LABELLED 0 AND THE ARTH-MATIC TASK DATA OF 1MIN IS LABELLED 1

3) DATA CONCATATING: BOTH THE DATA OF THE BEFORE ARTHMETIC TASK DATA AND THE AFTER ARTHMETIC TASK DATA IS CONCATED TO FORM THE FINAL DATA THAT IS TO BE FED TO THE MODEL

4) TRAIN_TEST_VALIDATION SPLIT:- USED THE TENSORFLOW DATASET.API FUNCTION TO CREATE THE DATSET.
                                 THEN GIVEN THE SPLIT OF THE 70/15/15
