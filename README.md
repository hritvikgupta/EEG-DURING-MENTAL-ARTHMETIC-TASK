# EEG-DURING-MENTAL-ARTHMETIC-TASK
RESEARCH PROJECT, AIM IS TO CLASSIFY THE EEG SIGNALS DURING THE REST STATE AND MENTAL ARITHMETIC TASK STATE

## objective: To Classify Active state and Inactive state of the signal using raw EEG dataset

### Dataset:  16 subjects loaded: each subect correspond to 2 file: before arthmetic task(3 min) raw EEG signals and during arthmetic task raw EEG signals(1min)

### Input: 21 features corresponding to 90k rows therefore final dataset size is 90k*21

### output: labels 0, 1 active or inactive respectively

### 3 models were tested in this experiment:

   -1) LSTM MODEL
   -2) BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM 
   -3) LSTM WITH ATTENTION
